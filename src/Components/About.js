                                Finished Step 1 locally Easy Peasy, but forgot I was supposed to plan ahead for the onboarding project 
                                and not just code along exactly as the video said to do. Redid Step 1 with a bit more foresight.
                                Got distracted and didn't manage to start Step 2 today. No challenges as of yet encountered, Brianna
                                and Mariana are asking good stuff! So, I'm hoping I can fully utilize whatever answers the "mentor-homies" 
                                come up with.

                                Decided to scrap whatever Step 1 I had. Planning to move forward build the project from scratch. Started with the easier pages,
                                I think I'll start with the page with the API on it. I'm thinking of using the GIPHY API just cuz I already have a key for it 
                                from a previous project we did in the TTP Bootcamp. A little lazy? I don't know, maybe just efficient? lol This whole thing still
                                Subject to change though.

                                Team Retro finished like 2 hours ago. Got the GIPHY API page working, now I just need to link it up to a Home Page. Then make
                                a Build Log Page ( Haha Ironic, now I have to retro everything I did so far. I should've done the About/ Build Log Page first)
                                Getting a little busy around here. Mom's Birthday is tomorrow so gotta prep some stuff tonight. This a challenge? Programming-wise?
                                Nah, I just need to manage my time better. I honestly think I won't have enough time to finish the refactoring and backend
                                part of the project. Started a day and a half late, gotta iron out the procrastination. It's not helping me out.

                                Totally going head first here by not doing the backend at all yet, but I gotta do what I can for now. I got a working GIPHY Page and 
                                Home Page, but they're not linking up. Getting an Error: Invariant failed: You should not use Link outside a Router. I need to review my 
                                frontend stuff again. Pretty big weakness right here, taking not of it since TTP Bootcamp. I'm pretty bad a linking stuff up, with pathing
                                and that sort of thing. I need to brush up on that. Other stuff I need to do, need to do the Saved Page. Stuff I managed to get done is the 
                                About ( I call it Build Log ) Page. Overall no major challenges so far.

                                Retro-ing today, totally got nothing done other than linking up the pages. Turns out I wasn't doing my imports AND pathing correctly. 
                                I was trying to add links without having a path for the program to follow so clicking links didn't do anything, but that's all patched up.
                                Signing out for today, lots of cooking and eating. Hopefully I can do more tomorrow, since I started a bit late and I need to catch up.

                                Woke up pretty late today. Had my Coffee and ready to work. Stuff to do: Actually put the code to GitHub, try to fix the GIPHY
                                search function (its kinda wonky), and see how far I can get with refactoring. Since that's probably something that I'll have trouble
                                with, but have been ignoring. Maybe I should see a therapist for avoidance or something lol.

                                Put it up on GitHub. I need to add Cam to my repo, but idk how lol. I'll get to it like 30 mins before the standup on Tuesday or something.
                                I honestly don't know how to add someone as a collaborator, I'll have to look it up. So, it's all dandy rn. I'm adding more Build Log
                                stuff as I go. I'm expecting to have a hard time trying to refactor the program with the backend-frontend running on one server,
                                realistically might not be able to finish that part, but If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go (Moana reference)

                                Woke up late again today, not good. A little panicky rn since this is up for review tomorrow at 11. But, honest effort I guess. Last stretch?
                                Going to try that refactoring probably up until the last hour before stand up tomorrow.

                                Last 3 hour effort to get that refactoring portion in. (Actually wasting a bit of time writing this in the build log lmao) Honestly, 
                                I should've just started sooner and asked more questions. Hindsight is 20/20 and what's done is done.

                                Yeah, I couldn't get the backend done. I spent too much time on the front end and trying to learn and relearn some things from the TTP
                                and the resources provided for us by the Lab. I did have some references in the form of our TTP projects, but I just couldn't get it done. 
                                Challenges? Personal hurdles for me were time management, foresight, and work discipline. Technical hurdles were refactoring, pathing, 
                                linking things together, and general full-stack knowledge. I can sort of see now that full-stack development requires a "plan" plan and
                                not just an outline.
